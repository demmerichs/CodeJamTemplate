# Implementation of examples
In this folder you can find example solutions using the template from this repo.
The directory structure starts with the year of the contest, then the round
(`KS` stands for the Kick Start competition, the rest is Code Jam).
Every solution contains the complete script which can be uploaded to the
CodeJam server (in case of python upload the `Solution_upload.py` created
by the [`execute.bash`](/CodeJam/execute.bash#L5) script) and a diff compared to the empty template
to get a feeling of how valuable in certain situations this template can be.
